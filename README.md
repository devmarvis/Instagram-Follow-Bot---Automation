# Instagram-Follow-Bot---Automation
Project for Day 52 of #100DaysOfCode 

Created an Instagram follow bot which automatically logs in user into their instagram account, search for a specified account/brand name, then follows the first 10 persons "following" that account.
In this program, I used Selenium library to run and control the web browser and also structured the code using Object Oriented Programming(OOP). Also imported the time module to a add a bit of delay for when a page is loading and also between button clicks.

The aim of this project is to help startup businesses who which to grow thier instagram account and studies have shown that following users on instrgames 60 - 70% of the time, you get a follow back.

To try out out this program, you can fork the project, open in your desired IDE, install all the required modules/packages, fill in your instagram email/username and password, type in the required brand/account name you wish to follow it's followers and run the program.
